				<h2>Education</h2>
				<p>Assly Sayyar was born in Great Britain and immigrated to the United States with her family as a child. Now happily a U.S. Citizen, Assly received her Bachelor of Arts in English Rhetoric, Cum Laude from the University of Alaska Anchorage in 2000. Thereafter she was admitted to the William S. Boyd School of Law and graduated in 2004 from this ABA accredited law school sixteenth in her class and Cum Laude. Admitted to the Nevada State Bar in 2004, Assly worked for several private practice firms and soon developed her skills as a trial attorney focusing on business and real estate related litigation.</p>
				<p>
Subsequently, Assly branched out and developed her skills as a transactional attorney assisting clients creating, negotiating, and drafting leases, stock purchase agreements, licensing agreements, independent contractor agreements, sale and purchase agreements, security and loan agreements, and a wide variety of other business and real estate contracts. In 2008, Assly was admitted to the California State Bar. Assly also continued her higher education and in 2010 received her Master in Arts in English Literature from the University of Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
				<h2>Experience</h2>
				<p>Assly has and continues to handle civil law suits from start to finish, taking potential clients through pre litigation options, litigation and/or arbitration, trial if necessary, post judgment appeal, and judgment collection. While her primary focus is that of civil litigation with an emphasis on trial work, she frequently calls upon her courtroom expertise to benefit clients with transactional needs. By knowing the pitfalls of business and real estate litigation, she can better serve the needs of her transactional clients who wish to avoid the courtroom. Her other past practice areas have included collection law, creditor and debtor bankruptcy law, receivership and special mastership, estate planning, premises liability and homeowner association law.</p>
				<p>After over 7 years of civil litigation and transactional practice in small and medium size firms in the Southern Nevada area, in May, 2012, Assly opened her own solo practice in the northern county of San Diego, California and continues to offer her skills as a trial attorney, civil practitioner and transactional attorney in both California and Nevada.</p>
				<p>In 2015, Assly Sayyar was named Of Counsel to Leakakos Law and in 2016 was named Of Counsel to Canon Law Services. Assly has grown her own legal team and works closely with Renie Leakakos, Esq. and Nooria Faizi, Esq. , naming both of counsel to her own law firm. Through strategic partnerships in both Nevada and California with a variety of skilled and experienced attorneys, clients receive the individualized attention and economic benefits of a small firm  with the benefit of multiple skilled attorneys that you would find in a large firm environment.</p>
