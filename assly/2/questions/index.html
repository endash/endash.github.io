				<h2>What are your office hours?</h2>
				<p>Office hours are 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday, excluding all Court holidays.</p>
				<p>However, accommodation can be arranged to meet with the attorney telephonically through video conference or Skype, through conference calls, before or after hours and/or at a business or home location as may be necessary or preferred. Please make sure that if you have a preference as to the meeting location and format, discuss that with the attorney or the attorney's staff when you schedule any meeting or appointment.</p>
				<h2>Does your office provide legal services in languages other than English?</h2>
				<p>At this time no, the law office does not provide legal services in languages other than English. If you require translation or interpretation, you must make your own independent arrangements to provide your own translator or interpreter for any communications you may wish to have with the law office and attorney.</p>
				<h2>How do I know if I want to hire Assly Sayyar to handle my legal issue?</h2>
				<p>Potential clients are invited to review this website and its information to see if Assly Sayyar's legal experience and skills meet the need of the potential client. For a more detailed determination, a potential client can contact the office directly to set up an initial consultation at which time Assly Sayyar herself will personally review the issues in question with a potential client to determine if the potential client wishes to retain this firm.</p>

				<h2>How do I contact the law office to set up an initial consultation?</h2>
				<p>Consultations may be set up by contacting the law firm telephonically during business hours or leaving a message after hours for a call back the following business day. The law office schedules consultations for a specific date and time to guarantee that a potential client has Assly Sayyar's attention and focus for the time necessary to review the legal issues.</p>
				<p>Consultations may also be set up by filling out the Initial Consultation Form. A reply email or follow up phone call will be made during which time an initial consultation date and time will be set.</p>
				<h2>Are consultations in person or telephonic?</h2>
				<p>Generally, unless special arrangements are made, the first portion of any initial consultation is telephonic with the attorney calling the potential client at a phone number at a set date and time. Additional necessary communications or follow up as may be necessary can occur telephonically, in person or via email as may be arranged between the attorney and the potential client.</p>
				<h2>Does the law office provide free initial consultations?</h2>
				<p>The law office does not provide free initial consultations for four key reasons.</p>
				<p>First, in business and real estate matters some initial document review is frequently necessary for the potential client and the law office to mutually determine if the case can or should be taken in the first place. Document review is also frequently critical in determining what options a potential client has to resolve their legal issue.</p>
				<p>Second, it is possible that some preliminary research may be necessary to evaluate whether the potential client wants to pursue a case or transactional matter further, how the potential client may want to pursue the case or matter further, and/or whether the law firm is the right "fit" for the potential client's needs. </p>
				<p>Third, as no free consultations are provided, a potential client is not limited to X amount of attorney minutes but has the freedom to talk and discuss the matter with Assly Sayyar at length before making the critical decision of whether to retain the attorney or not.</p>
				<p>Fourth, the attorney must take the time to ensure no conflicts of interest exist that would prevent Assly Sayyar from representing the potential client and for the potential client and the attorney to come to mutually agreeable terms of payment and retainer.</p>
				<p>It is for these reasons that consultations are not offered for free but for the flat fee price to be set based on the nature of the legal issue. This initial consultation fee must be paid before the first communication between the attorney and potential client. The cost of the initial consultation will be set on a case by case basis depending on the nature of the issue at the time the initial consultation is calendared.</p>

				<h2>What type of payment forms does the law office accept? How can I make a payment?</h2>
				<p>The law office accepts checks, U.S. dollars, certified funds, money orders, and all major credit cards. The law office does not accept debit cards. If you are paying by credit card other than in person at the physical location of the office, a credit card authorization will need to be faxed or emailed to you, filled out and returned before the law office can run the card. If you wish to pay in person, you can arrange to come by the office during normal business hours. You can also mail a payment to the office address. </p>
				<p>If the credit card is from a country other than the United States of America or does not primarily use U.S. currency, your credit card provider may charge you for currency exchange to U.S. dollars. Assly Sayyar, Attorney at Law is not responsible for such charges and you are instructed to check with your own credit card company before making such a transaction.</p>
				<p>If a credit card is denied or a check bounces, you will still be required to pay for services rendered under the terms of any retainer fee agreement. If a credit card is denied or a check bounces when paying for an initial consultation, the consultation will not begin unless and until payment is made and may have to be rescheduled if necessary.</p>
				<h2>What are the typical rates of payment for legal services?</h2>
				<p>The law office generally offers two types of payment arrangements depending on the services requested by the potential client. Please note, the information below is general in nature and is not a representation or a guarantee that these are the specific terms the attorney will offer a potential client. Each client who retains the attorney will receive a written agreement which sets out more specifically and particularly the exact payment arrangements between the attorney and client. Not all cases or legal matters can be paid by one or the other payment arrangements. More specialized types of payment arrangements are made on a case by case basis only at the attorney's discretion.</p>
				<p>First, the law office offers Flat Fees for certain unbundled services. This is a payment arrangement where the potential client requires limited services such as drafting a contract, sending a demand letter, obtaining a "second legal opinion" on a matter of law, reviewing a lease, or forming a corporate entity for example. For these services rather than charging by the hour, the attorney and potential client will agree to a fixed price for the service which is non refundable and will have a limited scope of representation. The flat fee price will generally cover all attorney client communication and work as specifically agreed in writing. Some flat fee unbundled services will include hard costs or related filing fees or vendor costs, some will not. It will depend on the written agreement reached between the attorney and client. The attorney will not perform any services outside the flat fee unbundled service agreement without written agreement from the client. Flat Fee rates vary depending on the size of the job and are tailor made on a case by case basis depending on the complexity of the work involved. Some illustrative examples of potential (but not guaranteed flat fee rates) are as follows: demand letter $350.00, document review and analysis $100.00 to $500.00, simple contract drafting $500.00 to $1,000.00. Actual flat fee rates will be by attorney discretion.</p>
				<p>Second, the law office offers Hourly Billing with an Evergreen Retainer. This is a payment arrangement where the potential client pays a retainer up front to the law office. Retainers are kept in a trust account by the law office and the attorney bills against that amount at a set hourly rate. Hard costs are also charged against the retainer. The client will receive a monthly retainer detailing not only what work has been performed but also how much of the retainer has been unitized and how much remains. Once the retainer is exhausted it must be replenished for the attorney to continue to work on the case. While the attorney will attempt to give as much notice as possible before requesting a replenishment of the retainer, it is not always possible given the unpredictability of lawsuits.</p>
				<p>Absent special written arrangements, Assly Sayyar charges hourly rates between $250.00 per hour to $300.00 per hour. Absent special written arrangements, the initial Evergreen Retainer depends on the nature of the case but can range between $2,500.00 to $5,000.00 generally, if not higher depending on the immediate legal work necessary to be performed in any new case. If a matter can be resolved without exhausting the initial or subsequent retainer amounts, the remainder will be released back to the client. Generally speaking all litigation cases, arbitration cases, contract negotiations, and lengthy to be negotiated manuscript legal contracts or documents are Hourly Billing matters with an Evergreen Retainer. </p>
				<h2>Do you take cases on contingency?</h2>
				<p>Generally for most business and real estate matters, the law office and attorney does not take contingent cases. Please contact the Nevada State Bar or California State Bar referral service through the link found on the Basic Legal Information Section to locate an attorney who offers such payment arrangements.</p>
