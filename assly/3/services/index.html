				<h2>Estate Planning</h2>
				<p>A lawyer is an invaluable partner in preparing for your financial and personal future. If you don’t take the time to plan for yourself, upon your death, retirement, disability, or incapacity the law will plan for you. If you leave things up to the law it can prove time consuming and expensive for your loved ones and contrary to your actual personal and business wishes. Some planning ahead of time can lessen the burden on your family if you become incapacitated or pass away. Whether you reside in Nevada or California, Assly Sayyar can assist you in preparing an Estate Plan which includes a trust, pour over wills, trust assignment documents, financial durable powers of attorney, health care directives, and other documents that reflect your final wishes. Through the use of buy/sell agreements and other succession planning documents, Assly Sayyar can ensure that your corporate and company entities also transition smoothly upon your passing or incapacity. If you simply want to sell your business at retirement, succession planning documents can also prevent lengthy legal battles between business partners regarding the valuation of business. Moreover, with the input of a client’s financial advisors and certified public accountant succession planning can assist in minimizing tax burdens. These legal documents are not just for the extremely wealthy. You can make sure your wishes are known and your family is protected in the future through estate and succession planning.</p>
