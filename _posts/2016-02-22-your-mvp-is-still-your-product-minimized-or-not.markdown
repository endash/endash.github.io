In [When Agile Isn't]({% post_url 2016-01-30-when-agile-isnt %}) I discussed how the idea of the "Minimum Viable Product" affords many different interpretations. I mentioned this graphic, which I just now stumbled across in an [article on software versioning](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/software-versions-are-broken-3d2dc0da0783#.ksapnxei9):

<div class="image"><img src="/assets/your-mvp-is-still-your-product-minimized-or-not-comic.png"></div>

I believe this is the original graphic, but I was misremembering it as making the opposite point. It advocates what I call the "concept-first" position, as contrasted with the "product-first" position that I encourage, as a  developer. In software development, for better or worse, an "MVP" is often—if not usually—constructed in terms of being the "MVP" version of some grander, more distant product. This needn't always be the case, but when it is the "concept-first" approach can be disastrous.

## Concept First

This can also be called the teleological MVP, or alternatively the function-over-form MVP. This approach emphasizes the principal value we're delivering for our users rather than how we intend to manifest that in a final product. That value is distilled, and minified, until we have a vision of a product which is significantly less effort than what we actually intend to make. So, if we're trying to create a sports car, as in the graphic, you might interpret the value as "getting from point A to point B more efficiently than walking," then squeeze that down until you arrive at a skateboard. Or a bike.

The chief problem with concept-first is that the idea of "MVP" does not exist in a vacuum. Like any tool it has to be measured by how well it helps us achieve the intended results. If you're developing a sports car—or the software equivalent—then an MVP is only valuable to the extent that it helps you to produce, eventually, a sports car. If you develop as your "MVP" the skateboard version of a sports car, where do you go from there? The only thing you can possibly do is to throw the skateboard away and start over, or become a skateboard company. The comic illustrates this process with smiley faces, implying that with each version you have happy users and thus are on the right path. In reality, it shows four product development dead-ends amounting to—in real terms—thousands of hours and potentially millions of dollars of wasted time and effort. Not to mention thousands of alienated users and/or investors.

## Product First

From a product perspective, we need to take a look at what we mean by minimal and by viable. Minimal, in one sense, means simply stripping things away until you get to a vital core. The tension is with viability—probably the most ambiguous of the three parts of "MVP." Some take the position that "viable" is in relation to the market... something is "viable" if it can be sold or marketed to users. I argue that "viable" is to be taken in the same meaning as a foetus being "viable," which is to say it is able to be carried to term. A minimum viable product, then, is the smallest set of features which can conceivably be developed into your product. An MVP should consist of an essential, enduring core of code that will form the foundation for further efforts. Anything else is simply a prototype or proof of concept.

This is where, from the perspective of trying to develop a sports car, the comic falls completely apart. Granted, a single wheel might be overkill, but stripping the car down to a chasis is certainly a minimum viable product. Not only will *any* car you develop from this point require and incorporate all the work done, but the thing is itself often sellable—car companies have "platforms" which are, at a minimum, shared amongst their labels and partners, and sometimes sold outright to other manufacturers. From a code perspective, that might mean core business logic is encapsulated into libraries or other licensable forms.

## Devil's Advocate

The discussion so far has been from the perspective of software development specifically, where we want to get to an MVP as quickly as possible as part of our development methodology directed towards something far larger. There's a more bottom-up perspective—less technical and more entrepreneurial—where concept-first can make a lot more sense, when producing and failing quickly and repeatedly—and cheaply—is a vital component of the business strategy. In the former scenario, an MVP is whittled down from something large to something small. In the latter case, the MVP is built up from nothing to solve a particular problem, and beyond the MVP is a question mark—open road. If that's your approach, then absolutely—get into the personal transportation space, and build a skateboard as your MVP. Be prepared, however, to go wherever your new skateboard company takes you. If, on the other hand, you really in your heart of hearts want to be a sports car company then all your MVP games are just burning time and money.

The comic doesn't fare well from this perspective, either. Clearly the impression we're given is that both teams started out intending to build the sports car. Both teams eventually produced the car, but team 2 failed-quickly-failed-often their way through four different MVPs first. The main lesson here is to know what you mean by "MVP," know what you want out of it, and know how it fits into your plans—both technical and business. It is not a talisman.
